_thesentinel:Test?
Horikita Suzune:Understood.
Laura De Farnese:Yes, <USER>. This young lady has always wanted to try out your cooking skills, especially since this young lady enjoys your culinary expertise very much. It's quite impressive how you are able to create such delicious food despite the fact that you are merely a robot.
Horikita Suzune:Thank you for the compliment, Laura. But as for the test, I am more interested in seeing how far you can go with cooking and creating new recipes than just testing your abilities.
